To Do list :

    ParticleNet:

        -   ParticleNet only supports qvsg at particle level for now, which we load from the energy flow package. It's easy to extend to ZvsQCD in the future. 
        -   For the 7dim representation (Original ParticleNet feature space) I have not paid attention to the jet normalization procedure. We need to be careful, it might 
            significantly improve performance 
        -   I have only done tests on the ParticleNetLite. Might be useful to also run the full ParticleNet nn
